You need **Python 3.10** (3.8 might also be supported, idk)

I recommend putting some shortcut to start the app on startup (when you turn on the computer).  
I do this on **Windows** like this:  
1. go to the startup folder
    1. press `Win + R`
    2. write `shell:startup`
2. Add shortcut (in File Explorer)
    1. `New Item`
    2. `Shortcut`
    3. In field `Type the location of the item` write `pythonw C:/path/to/on_computer_start.pyw`  
       (note that either python needs to be on PATH or write the full path to pythonw.exe)
    5. Complete the rest of the steps 

On other OS-es idk, good luck.
